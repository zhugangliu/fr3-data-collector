# 🤖 FR3 Robot Data Collection - Quick Start (Windows)

Welcome! This package contains the control scripts and the robot SDK required to run the grasping data collection.

## 📦 Package Contents
Ensure you have extracted the entire folder. The structure should look like this:
* `main.py` (Run this)
* `camera.py` & `control.py` (Modules)
* `fairino/` (The Robot SDK folder - **Do not move or rename**)
* `README.md`

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

This project is lightweight. You only need to install **OpenCV**.

### Option A: Using Standard Python (Recommended)
1.  Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** or **PowerShell** in this folder.
2.  Create a virtual environment:
    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  Activate the environment:
    * **Command Prompt:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
    * **PowerShell:** `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
    *(Note: If PowerShell says scripts are disabled, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` first)*
4.  Install the dependency:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

### Option B: Using Conda
If you prefer Anaconda/Miniconda:
```bash
conda create -n robot_env python=3.9
conda activate robot_env
pip install opencv-python

Save.

🚀 How to Run
Check Connections:

✅ Robot Emergency Stop is released (Blue light).

✅ USB Camera is plugged in.

✅ Ethernet is connected.

Start the Script:
(Make sure your virtual environment is activated)

Bash

python main.py
📋 Operation Logic
The script runs 10 automatic trials:

Reset: Robot moves to the starting pose.

Wait: A 5-second countdown appears. Place the object now.

Action: The robot automatically grasps and lifts.

Save: Data is saved to the data/ folder automatically.

📂 Data Output
Check the data/ folder for results:

Trial_X_..._Video.mp4: Recording of the grasp.

Trial_X_..._Robot.csv: Robot coordinates (XYZ) and Gripper status.

❓ Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fairino':
Make sure the fairino folder is in the same directory as main.py.

[Camera] Failed to open camera:
Unplug and replug the USB camera. If you have a laptop webcam, try changing camera_id=0 to camera_id=1 in camera.py.

PowerShell "UnauthorizedAccess":
Use Command Prompt (cmd) instead, or type Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process in PowerShell.
